# Project Description

Design and build an algorithm related to strings. This algorithm will help reuse texts for greeting cards, by modifying the original string according to a set of input pairs. Example:

S[] = “My dear Anna, let me congratulate you on the beautiful car that you purchased today. It looks very posh. I hope you got a good deal. Cars are expensive but much needed. Best regards, Naomi.”

LS[] = { {“Anna”, “Jovi and Victor”} , { “car”, “house”}, {“today”, “last week”}, {“posh”, “well
built”}}

Output:
R[] = “My dear Jovi and Victor, let me congratulate you on the beautiful house that you purchased last week. It looks very well built. I hope you got a good deal. Cars are expensive but much needed. Best regards, Naomi.”
